🛠️ How It Works
The program asks how many students you want to enter.
For each student, you input:
Name
Address
Marks
Grade

All data is saved into students.txt.

You can choose whether to search for a student’s details.
If the student exists, their details are shown; otherwise, you’ll see "Student not found."

main.py → The Python source code.
students.txt → Automatically created text file where student data is stored.
